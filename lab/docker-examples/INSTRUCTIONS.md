# Docker Migration Instructions

This directory is your workspace for creating Docker configurations to migrate the TaskManager Pro production system.

## Your Tasks

1. **Create Dockerfiles** for each service component
2. **Design docker-compose.yml** for orchestration
3. **Plan data migration** procedures
4. **Test and validate** the containerized system

## Suggested File Structure

```
docker-examples/
├── web/
│   └── Dockerfile              # PHP web application container
├── database/
│   └── Dockerfile              # MongoDB container (if custom needed)
├── cache/
│   └── Dockerfile              # Redis container (if custom needed)
├── docker-compose.yml          # Complete orchestration
├── .env                        # Environment variables
├── migration-plan.md           # Your migration strategy
└── scripts/
    ├── backup-data.sh          # Data backup procedures
    ├── migrate-data.sh         # Data migration procedures
    └── validate-migration.sh   # Post-migration validation
```

## Key Considerations

### Networking
- Services must communicate internally
- Web application must be accessible from host
- Database and cache should NOT be directly accessible from host

### Volumes
- Database data must persist container restarts
- Redis data should persist container restarts  
- Uploaded files must persist container restarts
- Consider backup and recovery scenarios

### Environment Variables
- Database connection settings
- Redis connection settings
- Application configuration
- Sensitive data handling

### Security
- Non-root users in containers
- Proper file permissions
- Network isolation
- Secrets management

## Getting Started

1. Study the current production system architecture
2. Identify all data that must be preserved
3. Plan your container design
4. Create and test each component individually
5. Integrate with docker-compose
6. Perform migration testing

Remember: This is a production system migration - data loss is NOT acceptable!
